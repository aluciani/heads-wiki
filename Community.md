Official Heads is over Matrix
===

* [Heads channel: official community channel, once bridged to Slack Heads OSFW room](https://matrix.to/#/#OSFW-Heads:matrix.org)
* [Heads-Changes channel: All github changes as a changelog channel](https://matrix.to/#/#Heads-verbose:matrix.org)

You can lurk the channels by not installing any client, use web browser as client if you register but full experience is through recommended Element client.

Matrix is a federated network: choose your home server

Matrix<->Slack bridge update
====

## Current Status

The Matrix<->Slack bridge for the Heads OSFW channel is currently non-functional. This situation arose due to the Slack channel transitioning from a paid to a free tier, which has limited functionality and retains only 90 days of chat history.

- The Matrix channel remains fully operational with complete chat history.
- The Slack channel has limited functionality and reduced message retention.
- The bridge between Matrix and Slack is inactive.

## Community Communication

**The community primarily communicates via Matrix and GitHub.**

- For optimal communication and full access to chat history, please use the Matrix channel (#heads:matrix.org) via Element or any compatible open-source client.
- GitHub remains an essential platform for project collaboration and issue tracking.

## Next Steps

We are working with the Slack channel administrators to resolve this issue. The bridge can be reactivated once necessary adjustments are made on the Slack side.

To restore the bridge functionality, action is required from Slack channel administrators (Ronald Minnich or Felix Singer).

## Contact

If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out through the Matrix channel or by opening an issue on the Heads-wiki GitHub repository.

Once the issue is resolved, please open an issue on the Heads-wiki to update this notice accordingly.

We appreciate your understanding and continued support as we work to improve our community communication infrastructure.
